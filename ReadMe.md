# SortViz

SortViz is a visualization tool designed to help users understand sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations. This project, implemented in C++ with SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), currently focuses on visualizing the bubble sort algorithm.

## Overview

Understanding sorting algorithms is fundamental to computer science and programming. SortViz aims to make this learning process more engaging and intuitive by providing real-time visualizations of sorting algorithms. With SortViz, users can witness the step-by-step process of sorting and observe how different algorithms rearrange elements to achieve a sorted sequence.

This project is still under development. 

## Features

- Visualization of the bubble sort algorithm. (More to be added)
- Random data generation for sorting demonstrations.
- Interactive controls to initiate sorting, generate new data, and quit the application.

## Todo
- Implement additional sorting algorithms
- Implement the accompanying controls
- Create a Docker image of the project to provide easy access to demonstrating the project
## Usage

1. Press `0` to generate a new set of random data.
2. Press `1` to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.
3. Press `q` to quit the application.
